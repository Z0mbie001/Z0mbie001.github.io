# Jack Babey's Website

This is the personal website of Jack Babey, it contains a Windows XP styled landing page, full CV, list of projects and someother secrets. 

Have a look around if you are interested. It is mainly designed to be a record of my projects.

## How to view

To view the website, just head to [https://z0mbie001.github.io/](https://z0mbie001.github.io/).

To view my profile, press the "My Computer" icon.

The other icons all do something (apart form "Task Manager"), so feel free to have a click around.
