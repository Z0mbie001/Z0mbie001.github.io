                <h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>This project was given to me at then end of first semester as a combination between mutliple modules.
                    It was a coursework given by 2 different lecturers for 3 different modules.</p>
                <p>Using the C programming language and any built in libraries, I created a TCP server
                    This server allows you to create logical graphs and manipulate them.
                    The system handles one client at a time, but the graph is retained for multiple successive clients.</p>
                <p>Due to this project being currently used for university courseworks, I cannot create a public repository with it in.
                    However, it can be made available upon request. 
                </p>
