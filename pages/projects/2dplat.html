                <h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>This project was created off the back of a Udemy Course I completed. 
                    It was the first course I completed to teach me about how to program using Unity Engine and C#</p>
                <p>This game sparked my interest in game development.
                    It taught me the basics of Object Oriented Programming, Unity Engine, Project File Management, Co-routines and UI.</p>
