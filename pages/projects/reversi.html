                <h2 id="project-desc">Project Description</h2>
                <p>This project was given to me at University, in year one.
                    It was a coursework given for my Java module.</p>
                <p>Using the Java programming language, I created a 2 person, SwingGUI based game.
                    It included creating a 'Greedy AI' to make the move that takes the most pieces.</p>
                <p>I was given 3 interfact scripts, and a few testing scripts to check functionality.
                    These scripts also ensured that I adheard to the object oriented paradigm.</p>
                <p>Due to this project being currently used for university courseworks, I cannot create a public repository with it in.
                    However, it can be made available upon request.</p>
