                <h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>This is a project I am creating to help me track my spending, and my budget.
                    While at Unviersity I realised the importance of knowing what I was spending money on. 
                    This led me to research some financial trackers, the most popular ones for home use were made using Excel.
                    However, I couldn't find one that I liked or had all of the features I needed. So I decided to make my own.</p>
                <p>This project is still a work in progress, but when it is completed, it should have all of the features I need, namely: Multiple Accounts, Budgeting, Transactions, Reports and Stats.</p>
                <p>This project is still in the early stages of development, so I'm not going to share the link yet.</p>
