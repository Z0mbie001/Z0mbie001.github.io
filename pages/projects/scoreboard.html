                <h2 id="project-desc">Project Description</h2>
                <p>I created this project as a fun example of what I could do using web development.
                    I used Supabase to create a backend database, which could be accessed using the REST API framework.
                    I then programmed a front-end system to interact and manipulate the database.</p>
                <p>The idea for this project stemmed from a joke around my friendship group at University, about creating a scoreboard.
                    It would mark our achievements, and points could be deducted based on various factors.
                    Having just completed our Databases & Interfaces coursework, I was confident that I could create a system that would handle this.</p>
                <p>The users have 2 websites which they can interact with, one shows the leaderboard, featuring nicknames and points. 
                    The second page allows them to log points gained based off of various cateogries with fixed point allowences.</p>
                <p>I also created an administator portal, as it would make managing the system easier, this includes being able to add/remove cateogries, add/remove players as well as adding/removing specific achievements.
                    This made it so that you never have to interact with the database directly. This page also features a fixed login, using a hashing algorithm, and cookies, to ensure you remain logged in when accessing the different functions.</p>
                <p>Creating this system was a great learning experience, and showed me the power of what web development can achieve.</p>
                <p>As Supabase is a free service, it only lasts 7 days without a request before closing the API link. To ensure that the website remains operational, I have setup cron-job.org to ping the database once a day.</p>
