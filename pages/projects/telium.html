                <h2 id="project-desc">Project Description</h2>
                <p>This project was given to me in the first year of Sixth Form. 
                    It was originally a brief created by "Craig 'n' Dave" as a mock GCSE Non-exam Assessment.
                    This can be found <a href="https://craigndave.org/product/text-based-adventure-game-telium/">here</a>.</p>
                <p>This project was originally designed to be a Python, Text-Based adventure game. 
                    However, I wanted to challenge myself and using my knowledge of Unity Engine, I decided to adapt the project to use this.</p>
                <p>To this end, I adjusted the brief to use a Graphical User Interface, luckily, Unity Engine has a good suite of User Interface objects built into it.</p>
                <p>Using this I was able to build a system, using the methods of Object Oriented Programming as best as I understood them at the time.</p>
