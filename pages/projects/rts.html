                <h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>This project is a Real-Time Strategy game. It invloves a complex resource managmenet system, with multiple building types.
                    It is based off of the game Settlers IV, which is an older game, but still one of my favorites.</p>
                <p>Creating this game is complex becuase of all the different parts that go into it. I am currently working on the resource collection and movement system.
                    This uses C# events and IEnumerators to achieve multi-threading and increased performance. Using C# events allows all relevant classes to be notified when there is a change.</p>
                <p>I used some pre-made assets, as my art and 3D modeling skills still need some work.</p>
                <p>As this game is still in the early stages of development, I'm not going to link the repository yet.</p>
