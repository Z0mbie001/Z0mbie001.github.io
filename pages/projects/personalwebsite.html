                <h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>I wanted to create a website that I could send to people to show what I could do and all my achievements.</p>
                <p>So I set to work designing the website you are using currently.
                    It displays all of my qualifications, achievements, hobbies and projects.
                    While I understand this cannot fully describe me as a person, I hope that this helps to show an objective opiniion on what I can do.</p>
                <p>Please continue exploring my website and I hope you enjoy seeing everything I'm working on and have completed.</p>
                <p>If you would like to have a look at the files for this project, please <a href="https://github.com/Z0mbie001/z0mbie001.github.io">click here</a>.</p>
