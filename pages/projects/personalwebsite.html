                <h2 id="project-desc">Project Description</h2>
                <p>I wanted to create a website that I could send to people to show what I could do and all my achievements.</p>
                <p>So I set to work designing the website you are using currently.
                    It displays all of my qualifications, achievements, hobbies and projects using a Static webpage, hosted using GitHub Pages.
                    While I understand this cannot fully describe me as a person, I hope that this helps to show an objective opinion on what I can do.</p>
                <p>I implemented a JSON system for generating both the initial profile (<a href="/pages/profile.html">here</a>) and the projects page (<a href="/pages/projects.html">here</a>)
                    This allows me to easily change details shown on the site using an external program (WIP), and reduces the chances of me breaking the whole website.</p> 
                <p>I'm currently working on using JSON files to generate the project pages, making it easier to update and change the project details and description.</p>
                <p>Please continue exploring my website and I hope you enjoy seeing everything I'm working on and have completed.</p>
                <p>If you would like to have a look at the files for this project, please <a href="https://github.com/Z0mbie001/z0mbie001.github.io">click here</a>.</p>
                <p>If you notice any bugs or improvements that can be made, please raise a GitHub Issue on the project page.</p>
                <h2>Screenshots</h2>
                <p>I mean, you're on the website currently, I'm not sure screenshots are requried.</p>
